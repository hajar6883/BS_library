This is a pricing library with modules for valuing European vanilla options using the Black–Scholes–Merton closed-form formula. We then extend the framework to price exotic derivatives using Monte Carlo or automatic differentiation.

This module is essential because it provides a benchmark price for Monte Carlo convergence, analytical Greeks to compare with numerical Greeks, and a control variate for Monte Carlo variance reduction.
